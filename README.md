# Cypress Testing for Buecher.de

This project is focused on **automated testing** of the **Buecher.de** website using **Cypress**. The goal is to verify core functionality, ensure the page loads correctly, and check that essential elements are present on the site.

## Technologies Used
- **Cypress**: A powerful framework for end-to-end testing in JavaScript.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Used to structure tests, making them more maintainable and scalable.

## Why This Project?
This project is part of my personal challenge to improve **web automation testing** skills by applying them to a real e-commerce website.
